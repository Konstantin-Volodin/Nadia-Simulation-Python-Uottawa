errors in code:
	1) patients with positive scan results always get positive biopsy? - not fixed? - not sure if a problem
	2) Number of patients served is different for different arrival rates????? WHY?????? - adjust the final numbers by a certain percentage??

not a problem:
	1) scan results distribution
	2) patient leave/balk rate
	3) delay number/distributions
	4) need for biopsy number
	5) staging

fixed:
	1) patient left after 1 scan not 2
	2) patient biopsy rate was (1-actual)
