1) single cancer type
2) arrival rate assumed to be approximately equal to demand
3) it is assumed that scan results are further dependent on the number of times a patient has already been scanned
	- if the patient is being scanned for the 1st time, scans are what data shows
	- the following are the probabilities for when a patient returns:
			Negative		Suspicious	Positive
		Return 0	   85%		   13%		   2%
		Return 1	  47.5%		   29%		   23.5%
		Return 3	  10%		   45%		  45%
		Return N	   same as above	  same as above	  same as above
	- This is done in order to 
		A) Reduce the unrealistic effect, where a patient can return many times before they leave the system. (Sometimes over 40 times)
		B) (NEED SOME RESEARCH TO BACK IT UP) It seems reasonable that patient will have higher chance of cancer over time
4) We assume that 9% of patient with negative scan leave the system and don't return for a follow up scan in a year. This percentage is the same as ((FIND NADIA EMAIL)
5) We assume that the probability of positive biopsy is different between patients with suspicious and positive scan results. The overall probability is 75% (from data). We assume 85% for positive and 75% for suspicious. (FIND SOME SOURCES FOR IT IDK)
6) We assume that probability of having a more severe cancer is higher the longer a person waits in queue. Probability of worse cancer changes every 6 months.
	- It grows as follows:
			Stage 1	Stage 2	Stage 3	Stage 4
	0-6 Month	63%	7%	15%	15%
	6-12 Month
